<p style="text-align:justify">Training and Placement Cell of Indian Institute of Technology organized a live Webinar on &ldquo;Cracking the code to Survive and Thrive&rdquo; by Amitabh Ray, Managing Director, Ericsson Global Services India, alumni of Columbia Business School, New York, in line with the ongoing weekend webinar sessions by eminent personalities from industry to share their knowledge and experiences with the students.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Our Training and Placement Officer, Mr. Kripa Shankar Singh, welcomed and introduced the guest speaker for the webinar and set the talk in motion. The guest mainly discussed the key ingredients for surviving dauntingly the unprecedented and chaotic events and disruptions occurring in the world. He presented a wide range of topics varying from chaos, to technology change to the industrial revolution to COVID-19 and ingredients for survival in unforeseen events.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ray vividly explained the various changes, unprecedented events and chaos one experiences through his personal life experiences and the disruptions that he faced in his career. Some of his own unique experiences are enlisted as follows.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-left:25px; line-height:22px;">
	<li>September 2001 &ndash; Global Terror</li>
	<li>December 2001 &ndash; Enron Bankruptcy</li>
	<li>October 2002 &ndash; PwC exits Consultancy: The Sarbanes Oxley Act forces Big 5 to separate audit from the advisory. PwC sells consulting business to IBM.</li>
	<li>September 2008 &ndash; Lehman Bros collapse</li>
	<li>January 2020 &ndash; COVID-19</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>Next, Mr Ray proceeded towards discussing the significant events reflecting the phenomenal changes that are occurring in the market, industry, education and in general, throughout the world. Some of the key points discussed are-</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-left:25px; line-height:22px;">
	<li>The velocity of technological change is phenomenal.</li>
	<li>65% of the jobs that will exist in 2030 haven&rsquo;t even been invented yet.</li>
	<li>Nearly 50% of subject knowledge acquired during the first year of a four-year technical degree becomes outdated by the time a student graduated.</li>
	<li>Conventional jobs, such as retail cashier, librarian, journalist, telemarketer, travel agents, will diminish and become obsolete. Roles such as AI engineer, technology ethicist, app developer, drone pilot, app developer, driverless car engineer, user experience engineer are some of the jobs that will present bright prospect in the coming years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mr. Ray said, &ldquo;the things we see all around us today will not be there tomorrow&rdquo;. He thus addressed the need to survive in unprecedented and ever-changing scenarios by striving to be agile, adaptive and analytical.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Ray explained how most of the major companies such as Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, got created as a consequence of an unprecedented event. He further explained how the current situation of COVID-19 boosted the Fourth Industrial Revolution. COVID-19 will bring about a large number of ICT opportunities.

</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify">The speaker discussed the curse of success, dominant logic and problem vs paradox concept. He explained that the problem has a fixed singular solution, and a paradox does not have a fixed resolution, it may have several viable solutions. Institutions teach us to deal with problems. However, one is faced with paradoxes in their practical life. Lastly, Mr. Ray explained the following essential qualities one must possess as a student, professional or an entrepreneur to survive unforeseen challenges of the current market-</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-left:25px; line-height:22px;">
